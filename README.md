# LÖVETALE Engine
<p>My third attempt at writing an Undertale battle engine in LÖVE with a goal of providing an easy framework for anyone to make their own accurate fanmade battles. Everything you need is in the "encounters" folder!</p>

## Controls
- Move - ↑←↓→ / WASD
- Confirm - Z / Enter
- Cancel - X / Shift
- Menu - C / Control
- Quit - Escape
- Fullscreen - F4 or F

<p>These are customizable in the `config.ini` file, as well as the enemy spare color, hitbox lenience, FPS, the usage of borders, and more.</p>

## Notes
- This engine isn't compatible with love.js.
    - The FPS limiter I use modifies love.run() which probably isn't supported by the program.
        - I was previously using an FPS limiter that supported love.js (which allowed for testing the engine in a website at least) but it made the controls feel a little weird so I switched back.
    - I switched to sceneman from my own old and bad scene manager but I'm not bothered to test it myself. If you're interested in doing it yourself, just remove all of the code in `fps.lua` or remove the require function in `main.lua`.
- The ACT and ITEM menu controls aren't one-to-one to the original game. I couldn't find a way to make it accurate while not having it hard-coded so they control a little differently.
    - Because of this, the ITEM menu supports unlimited items!
- This *does* serve as a battle engine for others to use, but to me this is primarily just a learning project! Some code could definitely use some touching up but regardless this project helped me learn a lot about LÖVE that'll come in handy in the future.

## How to Run
<p>I assume you already know how to do this but I thought I'd make these just in case!<br>An easy way to run this engine is to:</p>

- Install [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/)
- Zip the engine.
    - If you see an error talking about not being able to find main.lua, you didn't zip it correctly. Make sure main.lua is at the root of the .zip file.
- Change the file extention from .zip to .love.
- Double click the file.

<p>The engine should now be running!<br>Instructions for only avaliable for Windows and Linux because those are the only two OSes I have access to. Sorry!</p>

Optionally, you can load the engine's directory in Visual Studio Code and run it through an extension. I use [this one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pixelbyte-studios.pixelbyte-love2d).

### Windows

1. Open up the command prompt and set the directory as the directory of this engine.

    - An easy way to do this is to click on the directory entry on the top of the File Explorer and enter "cmd."

2. Run the command `"C:\Program Files\LOVE.exe" ./` (C:\Program Files\LOVE.exe can be wherever you installed LÖVE)

### Linux (Debian-based Distros)

1. Open up a terminal and install LÖVE: `sudo apt install love`
2. Go to the engine's directory and run `love ./`

### Linux (Arch-based Distros)

1. Open up a terminal and install LÖVE: `sudo pacman -S love`
2. Go to the engine's directory and run `love ./`
